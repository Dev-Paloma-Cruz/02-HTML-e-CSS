      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
      search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
      accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
    </p>

    <p>
      Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
      simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
      from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
      professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
      obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
      through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
      undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
      "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
      popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
      ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
      for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
      form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
      Rackham.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
      available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
      injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
      believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to
      be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
      All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
      chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
      It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
      model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
      The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
      injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
